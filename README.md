# SolarVision-Webpage

This repo contains the code for a webpage belonging to SolarVision, a company aiming to lead the charge of widespread renewable energy distribution by providing development, construction and financial solutions necessary for a successful transition into solar energy.

The page being developed in this repo specifically provides a look at some of the company's community solar panel farms. These farms contain individual panels funded by donors. Once constructed, the site will allow users to explore the solar panel farm and look at who donated each panel, as well as how much energy each panel has generated.
